Delta encoding mechanism to reduce the payload size by only transferring the diff.

# Introduction
HTTP/1.1 supports response compression via Accept-Encoding and Content-encoding headers. However, it does not provide a efficient mechanism for compressing data that is repeated across responses. [RFC 3229](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3229.txt) limits support to only responses that originate from the same URL. To get around this limitation, Google proposed a specfication called [Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2008JulSep/att-0441/Shared_Dictionary_Compression_over_HTTP.pdf) which extends support for cross-payload compression. The document tries to merge and extend these existing proposals with both cross-response payload compression and removing the need for an out-of-band dictionary download.

## Goals
- Enable incremental update one of one URL repsonse from a previous response for the same URL.
- Enable incremental update of one URL response from a previous response for another URL.
- Use properties inherent to the content to determine the content signature. i.e. use SHA256 or MD5. Do not use unreliable server side signatures like time-stamp or entity-tag.
- Support multiple delta transformation algorithms. e.g. vcdiff for text and [courgette](http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/software-updates-courgette) for binary.
enable negotiation of delta transform algorithms to accommodate yet to be discovered delta algorithms. e.g. new image diff algorithm to cater to change in image sprite.
- Be efficient by not introducing extra round-trips or bloating request payload.

##Non-Goals
- Specify new caching semantics. The goal is to respect the behavior of existing caching headers
- Specify a mechanism to generate the delta diff
- More ?
 
#Request and Response Flow
- When a user agent that is requesting a resource for the first time, it advertises its support for delta encoding via the "Accept-Encoding: delta" header along with a list of supported algorithms via "A-IM" header (for e.g. A-IM: vcdiff).
- When a user agent is requesting a resource that exists in its cache, in addition to the step above, it advertises the dictionaries that are available for that resource via the "Delta-Base" header (for e.g. "Delta-Base: content-signature1, content-signature2"). The user-agent generates dictionaries for the resource based on previous responses. These responses can be for either the same resource or for a different resource, but linked together by the new "Delta-Related" headers (see below). The user-agent MUST advertise support for delta encoding via "Accept-Encoding" if it sends a Delta-Base header. 


- When the origin server sees a request without a "Delta-Base" but with an "Accept-Encoding: delta" header, it does nothing differently with the body of the response.- i.e. it sends back the response as it would have before. However, it MAY choose to indicate to the client that this response can be used as a delta-base for future requests via a "Delta-Related" header. For e.g. a request for http://somesite.com might generate a response with the headers 
    Delta-Related: "domain:.somesite.com"
and a request for http://anothersite.com/foo might generate a response with the headers 
    Delta-Related: "path:/foo, /bar"
This allows dictionaries to be defined on responses at both a domain and path level. Domain matching is as per RFC2965. (TODO) Path matching rules are specified below

- When the origin server sees a request with a "Delta-Base" header, it MAY choose to send back the response encoded as a delta to one of the entities specified in the "Delta-Base" header in the request. If it chooses to send back a delta-encoded response, it MUST respond with "Content-Encoding : delta" and MUST pick one of the user-agent advertised transformation algorithms. The algorithm by the server is sent back in the response in the IM header (for e.g. "IM: vcdiff"). Further, it MUST pick an entity from the user-agent supplied list of entities in the "Delta-Base" header and return that in the response.

- The user-agent computes the delta after it receives the response by applying the selected transformation algorithm to the base that has been picked by the server 

- The resource corresponding to the decoded response is then cached according to standard HTTP semantics. 

- This flow is expected to work with existing HTTP validation semantics including If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match.

#Validating the Response 


 

#Examples
+ Client does not have a cached "Delta-Base" for requested URL.
  - Server does not indicate use of the response as a "Delta-Base" in future requests.
  - Server indicates use of the response as a "Delta-Base" for future requests. It also provides matching patterns.
+ Client advertises a "Delta-Base" in request. "Delta-Base" is pervious version of the same URL.
  - Server uses the base to compress the response. It also suggests it be used as "Delta-Base" for future requests.
  - Server uses the base in response, but does not suggest that it be used as future base. The base will not participate as a base in future requests.
+ Client advertises "Delta-Bases" from a different URL in request.
  - Server chooses the "Delta-Bases" to compress the response.
  - It marks the new response to serve as "Delta-Base" for future request. Now, both the old and new can serve as future base.
+ Client advertises multiple "Delta-Bases" from different URLs in request.
  - Server chooses one of the "Delta-Bases" to compress the response.
+ Client advertises an expired resource as "Delta-Base"
  - Server uses the expired "Delta-Base" to compress the new response.
+ Client advertises multiple delta compression protocols in request
  - Server chooses one protocol in response.
